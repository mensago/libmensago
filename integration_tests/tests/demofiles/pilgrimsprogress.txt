DELIVERED UNDER THE SIMILITUDE OF A DREAM BY JOHN BUNYAN


The Author's Apology for his Book

When at the first I took my pen in hand
  Thus for to write, I did not understand
  That I at all should make a little book
  In such a mode; nay, I had undertook
  To make another; which, when almost done,
  Before I was aware, I this begun.

  And thus it was: I, writing of the way
  And race of saints, in this our gospel day,
  Fell suddenly into an allegory
  About their journey, and the way to glory,
  In more than twenty things which I set down.
  This done, I twenty more had in my crown;
  And they again began to multiply,
  Like sparks that from the coals of fire do fly.

  Nay, then, thought I, if that you breed so fast,
  I'll put you by yourselves, lest you at last
  Should prove ad infinitum, and eat out
  The book that I already am about.

  Well, so I did; but yet I did not think
  To shew to all the world my pen and ink
  In such a mode; I only thought to make
  I knew not what; nor did I undertake
  Thereby to please my neighbour: no, not I;
  I did it my own self to gratify.
