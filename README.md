# libmensago

A library written in Rust for implementing [Mensago](https://mensago.org) client software released under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

## Description

This library will provide all the necessary business logic to implement a Mensago client, from client-side storage, to client-server communications, to identity management. Once stable, a C interface will be created so that languages that support the C FFI will be able to easily create bindings.

## Status

libmensago is pre-alpha and under active development.

## Building

Building libmensago requires the Rust toolchain. Check out the repository and run `cargo build`.
